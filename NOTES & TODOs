TODO:
1) - move old deals onto a "closed" board
2) Figure out a way to get fee and waterfall structured data
3) Connect with RealtyMogul
- Figure out a way to deal with fuzzy number / date data to clean it up consistently
-- Work with this library "spacy" once figure out realtyshares.
- Try getting sponsor info and put in the sponsors list & connect to prospective deals
- Build out connection for RealtyShares or some other site.

- Fix up the platform class and make sure that plays nice with the rest of the program.
- Make the column "platform" A list eventually as well.

IN PROCESS:
- Figure out how to input List items to AirTable.
-- A: you HAVE to select one of the values from the list.  You can't add new ones from API apparently.
-- I would suggest doing at least 4-5 sites, getting all the values there and then converting to a list and doing fuzzy matching going forward.

SITES CONNECTED:
- CrowdStreet
