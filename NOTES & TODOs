TODO:

- Figure out a way to deal with fuzzy number / date data to clean it up consistently
-- Work with this library "spacy" once figure out realtyshares.
- Try getting sponsor info and put in the sponsors list & connect to prospective deals
- Build out connection for RealtyShares or some other site.
- move old deals onto a "closed" board
-- I think this should probably work as follows:
-- 1) go through all NEW deals and when find a match from existing DB, update and mark as "checked"
-- Once finish all new deals if there are any deals in the DB which are still "unchecked" then go to those URLs and get the status
-- For either deals found during new deal phase or later that are discovered to now be closed or on the Waitlist, move to closed "and maybe waitlist sheet"
- Make the column "platform" A list eventually as well.

IN PROCESS:
- Figure out how to input List items to AirTable.
-- A: you HAVE to select one of the values from the list.  You can't add new ones from API apparently.
-- I would suggest doing at least 4-5 sites, getting all the values there and then converting to a list and doing fuzzy matching going forward.

SITES CONNECTED:
- CrowdStreet


DONE:
- Fix up the platform class and make sure that plays nice with the rest of the program.
